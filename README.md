# Synthosphere
Synthosphere is a hackathon project.It involves creating Verilog code to describe circuit behavior (pre-synthesis) and then translating it into optimized gate-level representations (post-synthesis) using synthesis tools.

# 16-bit single cycle MIPS Processor

A 16-bit single-cycle MIPS processor is a simplified computer processor that operates on 16-bit data and instructions. It executes each instruction in just one clock cycle, making it straightforward but potentially limiting in terms of performance. This processor includes a basic set of components like registers, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a control unit, memory units for instructions and data, and a simple pipeline for instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages.

__Instruction Set of 16-bit MIPS Processor__
```
LW: Load Word - Load a 16-bit value from memory into a register.
SW: Store Word - Store a 16-bit value from a register into memory.

Arithmetic and Logic Instructions:
ADD: Add - Add two registers and store the result in a destination register.
SUB: Subtract - Subtract one register from another and store the result.
AND: Bitwise AND - Perform bitwise AND operation between two registers.
OR: Bitwise OR - Perform bitwise OR operation between two registers.
XOR: Bitwise XOR - Perform bitwise XOR operation between two registers.

Control Transfer Instructions:
BEQ: Branch if Equal - If two registers are equal, branch to a specified address.
BNE: Branch if Not Equal - If two registers are not equal, branch.
J: Jump - Unconditionally jump to a specified address.

Immediate Instructions:
ADDI: Add Immediate - Add a constant value to a register.
ANDI: Bitwise AND with Immediate - Perform bitwise AND operation with a constant.
ORI: Bitwise OR with Immediate - Perform bitwise OR operation with a constant.

Shift Instructions:
SLL: Shift Left Logical - Shift the bits of a register left by a specified amount.
SRL: Shift Right Logical - Shift the bits of a register right by a specified amount.
